# The Punjab Thalassemia Prevention and Programme (PTPP) generated the dataset for this study. The Pakistan Thalassemia Prevention Program (PTPP) is a public-sector research institute in Pakistan that works to prevent thalassemia and other hereditary illnesses. The Department of Specialized Healthcare and Medical Education administers it. To achieve its primary aim of identifying thalassemia carriers, the program conducts annual screenings on more than 300,000 patients. While the PTPP also provides medical care for patients with thalassemia major, it emphasizes the significance of screening the extended family to reduce the number of carriers. To achieve this, if one family member is diagnosed with thalassemia major, all of their other relatives should also be evaluated.
As shown in Figure 1, the dataset for this investigation consists of information from 5066 patients who underwent screening in 2019. Out of these patients, 3051 did not carry the thalassemia gene, while 2015 did. In addition, the data set is divided by gender and age, with 53% males and 47% females, and by age, with 54% adults and 46% children.
